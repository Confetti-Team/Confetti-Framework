# Confetti-Framework
Welcome to the Confetti Framework, The Confetti Framework helps Programmers and Engine Developers create Game Engines faster by focusing on the hard and boring parts of Engine Development.

The Framework is empty for now, overtime - We will slowly build up the Framework and we will release a 1.0 for people to use.
